# Taskbar shortcut converter
Download the .jar file to use the program

A simple application for converting .url shortcuts to .Ink shortcuts which can be pinned to the taskbar. 
Note that i am no professional, and there might be bugs and glitches. My code might not be the best, but from my experience it works atleast.
