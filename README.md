# Check out new version: https://github.com/kris10ansn/shortcut-converter
Download the .jar file to use the program. No other files needed

A simple application for converting .url shortcuts to .Ink shortcuts which can be pinned to the taskbar. 
Note that i am no professional, and there might be bugs and glitches. My code might not be the best, but from my experience it works atleast.
